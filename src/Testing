//Implement an array based list
//Doubling capacity
//keep track of how many times the array resizes

//three classes
-> A skeletal book class
-> BookListSystem class (resizing will be defined in here) -> Logic of the program will be implemented here
-> Main program to demo how program runs -> Will also contain test cases of program


Skeleton of Program Implementation
Book Class
-> Attributes
- ID of Book
- Author
- Availability
- title of book

-> Constructor

-> Getters

-> To String method for nice output of program

BookListSystem Class
-> Attributes
-Fixed size array chunk
-> chunk: we are dividing one large size array into smaller pieces for efficient management of book objects
- One array chunk of array chunks
- number of books in system
-
