//Implement an array based list
//Doubling capacity
//keep track of how many times the array resizes

//three classes
-> A skeletal book class
-> BookListSystem class (resizing will be defined in here) -> Logic of the program will be implemented here
-> Main program to demo how program runs -> Will also contain test cases of program


Skeleton of Program Implementation
Book Class
-> Attributes
- ID of Book
- Author
- Availability
- title of book

-> Constructor

-> Getters

-> To String method for nice output of program

BookList Class
-> Attributes
-Fixed size array chunk
-> chunk: we are dividing one large size array into smaller pieces for efficient management of book objects
- One array chunk of array chunks
- number of books in system
- count of times we've added a new chunk (resizes)
-
-> Constructor

-> Methods
- add (to the end of the list)
- insert (to any position in the list)
- get (retrieve any book at any position)
- size (returns an integer representing size of book list)
- print (prints/ displays all books in the system)


BookList System Class
-> Main Class
->Switch case statements to handle user inputs
-> Print resize count at end
->
